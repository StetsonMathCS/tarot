not: one constructor to different courses
class in the same room for every meeting (generally, simplified)

* Consistencies which makes it easier. 
don't make it too abstract (maybe some consistent things hardcoded)

List of courses and a number of sections
- All constraints in the same view. 
like a flight reservation. 

2 step interface (set all constraints <-> list or similar)

Biggest issues csci: can't really schedule more than 2/3 csci courses which have labs or similar. 
- Number of labs is limiting number of sections

hard/medium/soft constraints

no users needed -> login via password (no account). 

set constraints -> generate most optimal courses. 

share links (hash for generated data -> save generated data in db and access via link over hash for sharing)
-> url only allows a certain amount of bytes. 

in perfect way no more than 18 people per course (maybe add configuration in form of slider or similar)

there are constraints when a class is allowed to be done. 

tricky additional thing: 4 days instead of 5. as far as i know.
